Based on arXiv:2209.14667 (Domain-aware Self-supervised Pre-training for Label-Efficient Meme Analysis). 

Description of project: 
We are specifically working on self supervised pre-training method MM-SimCLR introduced in above paper. This paper presents the design and evaluation of efficient multimodal frameworks that do not rely upon large scale dataset curation and annotation and can be pretrained using the datasets from the wild.
